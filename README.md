## Gruppe Plakolb

This repository contains supporting materials for my course at the University of Graz in the winter semester 2020/21.

+ ```notebooks/``` contains the lecture notes. Due to the circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis these notes may follow a slightly different structure than layed out during the lecture videos.
+ ```homework/``` is the directory where you can find the accompanying exercises. Points can only be gained if the results are properly handed in through Moodle.
+ ```utils/``` utility jupyter-notebooks and other resources can be found here.

## Requirements

You can check if your installation meets all the requirements by running the ```utils/SystemCheck.ipynb``` notebook.
